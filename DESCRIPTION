Description: This package provides a useful summary table of important statistics,
 including the minimum and maximum values, the mean and the standard deviation - 
 through the use of a simple function called summary_function. This function works
 when you want to create the summary statistics simultaneously for a numerical 
 variable 'y' when grouped by another variable 'cat', which reflects a condition
 or categorical variable.
